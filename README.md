# On-Track
On track is a chrome extension that will track the time you spend by domain and provide informative visualizations of that data in the New Tab pane. 

### Features

- Tracks usage by domain for all sites you visit while not browsing incognito.
- Tracks number of visits to each domain while not browsing incognito.
- Optional notifications when you've been on a particular domain for too long on a given day. 
- The window of use before receiving these notifications can be configured.
- Notifications can be snoozed for a short period of time when turned on.
- At the moment, tracking starts when the extension is installed and is not reset each day.

### Coming soon

- Rollover for notifications and newtab display to show only clicks and time spent by day.
- Ability to tag time-waster domains, and only show notifications for those that are tagged.
- Visualizations for most visited domains by clicks and by time spent accessible from newtab page.
- Checks for incognito behavrior.
- Option to clear saved data.
- Option to export saved data (likely JSON)

On-Track is still in beta and not yet published on the chrome web store, some features are not fully implemented.
